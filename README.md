# hello-world
The beginning

It is time for me to start focusing on developing my coding skills.  I have a little experince with these languages, Javascript, html, css, SQL, C++, and Python.  I will put all my focus into Python as of right now, until I feel like I have mastered the language.  I know it will be a few years of dedicated work everyday of learning and implementing.  I will come up with as meny programs as I can create.  I hope one day I can create a program that will make someones life easier.  I would like to get into A.I., neural network, and/or Machine learning.  I hope it leads me to the path of deep learning.
